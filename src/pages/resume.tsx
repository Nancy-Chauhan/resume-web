      <Intro>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer based in Bangalore, India with 2 years of
          experience in the software industry. My focus area for the past few
          years has been back-end development with Java and Go, but I'm also
          skilled in Python, NodeJS and front-end development with React.</p>
        <p>I currently working at Gojek, building Gopay, a e-wallet for south-east
          asia. I have made a considerable amount of contribution to open-source.
          I maintain a popular NodeJS module called `bcrypt`, which gets around
          2 million installs every day making it one of the most used NodeJS
          modules. I have worked with the FOSSi Foundation as part of the Google
          Summer of Code, 2017, and the Fedora Project as part of the Google
          Summer of Code, 2018</p>
        <p>
          When not coding, I love to revel in creativity &mdash; I draw, paint,
          sketch and cook. I'm also a passionate gamer. I like djent, metal and
          rock music.
